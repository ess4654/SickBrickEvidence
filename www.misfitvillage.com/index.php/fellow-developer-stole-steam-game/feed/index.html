		<description><![CDATA[1st. of let this be a lesson to you in all that is business. there are no friends and you should never allow anyone to sign anything in your name without it being mentioned in the document.
2nd. I trully wish you the best of luck in your future endevours and do not let this shamefull mishap divert you from you passion.
3rd. Look in to DMCA further. Both Steam and Youtube use DMCA-like systems that are not acctually DMCA. File an official DMCA takedown to Steam not through Steam (I&#039;m am not a lawyer get in touch with one in the US)

Also try to get in touch with John Bain (The Cynical Brit) and or James Nicholas Stanton (Jim Sterling from The Jimquisition) they both have expirince with DMCA and are likely to help you. If I remember corectly there is a NGO in the US that helps people with DMCA issues for free.
Ethan Edward Klein aka Ethan from h3h3productions is also a great guy that might take great interest in your story.]]></description>
