		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t &quot;make some models&quot;. I made all the levels, story, most of the music, enemies, animations, entities and so on. Everything except programming and some voice acting. Of course I had my name as the owner of the game. It said &quot;Developer: Mladen Bošnjak, Ron Mcdowell&quot; on Steam until he kicked me off of Steamworks and changed everything. It seems to me from what you&#039;re saying you did not read the first part of the story: http://www.misfitvillage.com/index.php/fellow-developer-stole-steam-game/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It really sucks you got royally fucked over by Maxwolf and had your game stolen from under your nose. I&#039;m absolutely and utterly speechless by all this - I used to be friends with this asshole until around October 2017, when he decided to fire me from staffing at a convention, accusing me for a lack of professionalism, all while bullshitting other people to the point where I couldn&#039;t work at other events, either.

He gave me all three of &quot;his&quot; games for free. I feel even dirtier having these games on my list knowing now they had their assets ripped off by a dickhead who isn&#039;t even a fucking Canadian in the first place!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After their counter claim you could&#039;ve contracted a lawyer to get a real process against the game, that&#039;s how the legal process on steam works. Besides do you had at any moment partnership over the game legally speaking (did you had your name as owner), or your&#039;re only making some models, cuz if the case is the latter you have no rights over the game. And lastly, what payment method was on the contract you signed before doing the work, did they signed to pay you a portion for as long as the game exists? cuz if not they are no doing anything wrong. Besides if you complain to steam again and your claim is found false you can be sued by steam.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Damn man, I&#039;ve been working hard on my game and if this something like this had happened to me I wouldn&#039;t know how to react. Good luck with your future projects, you should update us here on the name of it, I&#039;d be glad to support you regardless of what your next game might be based off this situation alone. Always sad seeing honest, hard working people get the boot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s not a terrible idea. I mean, if the guy isn&#039;t getting paid for his work as it is, he may as well do something to ensure that the crook who stole his work isn&#039;t getting paid for it either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From /u/Plzbanmebrony on https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/6kugf2/help_raise_awareness_for_this_indie_game_dev_who/, &quot;Idea! If you claim owner ship of the game and have a build simply release a free version. He would have to sue you to get anything done and it would most likely backfire on him. You can fuck him royally like that. Even better go through steam. Though check with a lawyer. Replace everything he worked on too.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1st. of let this be a lesson to you in all that is business. there are no friends and you should never allow anyone to sign anything in your name without it being mentioned in the document.
2nd. I trully wish you the best of luck in your future endevours and do not let this shamefull mishap divert you from you passion.
3rd. Look in to DMCA further. Both Steam and Youtube use DMCA-like systems that are not acctually DMCA. File an official DMCA takedown to Steam not through Steam (I&#039;m am not a lawyer get in touch with one in the US)

Also try to get in touch with John Bain (The Cynical Brit) and or James Nicholas Stanton (Jim Sterling from The Jimquisition) they both have expirince with DMCA and are likely to help you. If I remember corectly there is a NGO in the US that helps people with DMCA issues for free.
Ethan Edward Klein aka Ethan from h3h3productions is also a great guy that might take great interest in your story.]]></description>
